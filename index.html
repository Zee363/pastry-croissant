  <h1>&#129360;Croissant</h1>
  <p>A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough.

The dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in a process called lamination. The final dough is cut into triangles and rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a layered, flaky textured roll, more like puff pastry.</p>
